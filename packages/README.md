Cobalt installer packages
================

These are packages used by the Cobalt installer. They are compressed into ZIP files during the compiler process, and copied to CDROOT for use by the installer.

### Base

'Base' is the package that contains most of the software included with Cobalt. This includes [4DOS](https://www.4dos.info/), [DOSLFN](http://adoxa.altervista.org/doslfn/), and dozens of programs from the FreeDOS repositories.

### Desktop

'Desktop' only contains the [OpenGEM](https://github.com/shanecoughlan/OpenGEM) 7 RC3 desktop.
